#  Plenty. Sequence. Part  
Read statements of mathematical logic, construct their negations and establish the truth.
Given three sets a, b and C. It is necessary to perform all the studied types of binary operations on all combinations of sets.
*Complete task 1 in Python
# Plenty. Sequence. Part 2
1) How are the concepts of sequence and set related?
2) 4 sequences are given. It is necessary:
to examine them for monotony;
to investigate for limitation;
find the fifth member.
3) Find the 12th term of an implicitly given sequence.
4) In Python to propose an algorithm that computes numerically the limit
