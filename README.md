#  2 lesson. Plenty. Sequence. Part  
Read statements of mathematical logic, construct their negations and establish the truth.
Given three sets a, b and C. It is necessary to perform all the studied types of binary operations on all combinations of sets.
*Complete task 1 in Python
# 3 lesson. Plenty. Sequence. Part 2
1) How are the concepts of sequence and set related?
2) 4 sequences are given. It is necessary:
to examine them for monotony;
to investigate for limitation;
find the fifth member.
3) Find the 12th term of an implicitly given sequence.
4) In Python to propose an algorithm that computes numerically the limit
# 4 lesson. Subject “Function limit”
To offer an example of a function that has no limit at zero and at infinity.
Give an example of a function that has no limit at a point, but is defined in it. Explore the function according to the plan:
The task area and the value area.
Zeros of the function and their multiplicity.
Segments of the sign of constancy.
Intervals of monotony.
The parity of the function.
Limitations.
Periodicity.
Find the limit.
